# Roomie
A full-stack (MERN) web app to help students quickly find roommates and review residences.  
Google OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Token (JWT) so users can log in or sign up with either email or google account.

Early Prototype demo:
YouTube Demo: https://youtu.be/1iuudDywLag

Still alot of room for improvement.
Have basic functionality but I want to launch this to be actually used by people.
There are alot of little details and UX parts to be ironed out.
Reach out if you would like to join this project.
